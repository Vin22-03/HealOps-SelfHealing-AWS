  <h1 class="h1">About HealOps</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    HealOps is a cloud-native reliability project that demonstrates how modern AWS systems
    detect failures, recover automatically, and maintain application continuity without
    manual intervention. The goal is simple — show cloud resilience in action.

    <h2 class="h2">What this project demonstrates</h2>
    <p>
      HealOps captures the real behavior of AWS-managed infrastructure. Whenever a
      container stops, becomes unhealthy, or fails during deployment, AWS emits events
      describing what happened. These events are recorded, analyzed, and displayed in a
      clear incident timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a failure occurs, the ECS service automatically launches a replacement task to
      maintain availability. HealOps observes this recovery and measures the time it took
      from detection to restoration — giving a transparent view of system behavior during
      disruptions.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Nothing is artificially generated. Failures are real, detection is event-driven,
      recovery is performed by AWS, and metrics like MTTR are calculated from real-world
      timestamps.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m <b>Vinay V Bhajantri</b>, a Cloud & DevOps engineer passionate about automation,
      infrastructure reliability, and building systems that behave predictably under
      failure. I enjoy working with AWS services, container platforms, and Infrastructure as
      Code to create environments that are robust, observable, and easy to operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      HealOps represents my learning journey and my interest in understanding how cloud
      systems react during failure scenarios. It highlights how observability, automation,
      and managed services can work together to create dependable infrastructure.
