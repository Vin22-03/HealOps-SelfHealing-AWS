  <h1 class="h1">About HealOps</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    A recruiter-facing SRE/DevOps showcase built with a <b>failure-first mindset</b>.
    The goal is not to pretend “magic self-healing” — the goal is to demonstrate how real systems detect failure and recover, and how we quantify MTTR.

    <h2 class="h2">What this project proves</h2>
    <p>
      HealOps demonstrates incident lifecycle thinking: you can see <b>what broke</b>, <b>when it broke</b>, <b>how it was detected</b>,
      <b>what healed it</b>, and <b>how long recovery took</b>. The dashboard is intentionally designed so the data source can evolve:
      today it reads demo incidents; later it can ingest real AWS signals without rewriting the UI.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      This is audit-friendly and honest by design: no unsafe chaos buttons, no fake “auto-heal” claims — only observed reality.

    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>AWS ECS (Fargate)</b> — service scheduler for task replacement</li>
      <li><b>Application Load Balancer</b> — health checks + traffic routing</li>
      <li><b>Terraform (IaC)</b> — repeatable infra</li>
      <li><b>Jenkins CI/CD</b> — automation-first provisioning & deployment</li>
      <li><b>FastAPI UI</b> — dashboard + APIs (demo now, live later)</li>

    <h2 class="h2">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <b>Vin (VinCloudOps)</b>, a Cloud & DevOps engineer focused on reliability, automation, and scalable systems.
      I like building infrastructure that assumes failure is normal — and recovery must be measurable.
      My work style is automation-first: IaC over manual clicks, repeatability over hero debugging, and clarity over complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      HealOps reflects how I think: surface incidents clearly, capture timelines, quantify MTTR, and document learnings like a real SRE team would.

    <h3 class="h3">Next: Live AWS signals (non-negotiable)</h3>
    <p class="muted">
      We will replace demo incidents with real AWS signals: ECS task stop events, ALB target health changes, and CloudWatch alarms.
      The UI is already built to consume <code>/api/*</code> responses — only the backend data source changes.
