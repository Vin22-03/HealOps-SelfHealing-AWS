  <h1 class="h1">About HealOps</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    HealOps is a hands-on SRE & DevOps project built with a <b>failure-first mindset</b>.
    Instead of assuming systems never fail, it demonstrates how real cloud systems
    <b>detect failures, trigger recovery, and measure MTTR</b>.
  </p>

    <h2 class="h2">What this project proves</h2>
    <p>
      HealOps shows the complete incident lifecycle using real AWS behavior.
      For example, when CPU usage spikes or a container becomes unhealthy,
      <b>CloudWatch alarms</b> and <b>ECS task state change events</b> are emitted.
      These signals are captured via <b>EventBridge</b> and recorded as incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an ECS task stops or becomes unhealthy, the <b>ECS scheduler</b>
      automatically replaces the task to maintain the desired count.
      HealOps observes this recovery and calculates <b>MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)</b>
      based on actual timestamps — not assumptions.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Nothing here is simulated: failures are intentional, detection is event-driven,
      healing is handled by AWS, and recovery time is measured from real signals.

    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>AWS ECS (Fargate)</b> — container orchestration and task replacement</li>
      <li><b>Application Load Balancer</b> — health checks and traffic routing</li>
      <li><b>CloudWatch</b> — metrics, alarms, and operational signals</li>
      <li><b>EventBridge</b> — event-driven detection (task stopped, alarms)</li>
      <li><b>AWS Lambda</b> — incident ingestion and persistence</li>
      <li><b>DynamoDB</b> — incident timeline and MTTR storage</li>
      <li><b>Terraform (IaC)</b> — repeatable and auditable infrastructure</li>
      <li><b>Jenkins CI/CD</b> — automated build and deployment</li>
      <li><b>FastAPI</b> — dashboard APIs and UI rendering</li>

    <h2 class="h2">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <b>Vinay V Bhajantri</b>, a Cloud & DevOps engineer(Entry level) with a strong focus on
      reliability engineering, automation, and scalable cloud systems.
      I believe failure is normal in distributed systems — what matters is
      <b>how quickly and safely systems recover</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      HealOps reflects how I approach infrastructure: design for failure,
      rely on AWS-native recovery mechanisms, automate everything using IaC,
      and measure outcomes using clear metrics like MTTR.
